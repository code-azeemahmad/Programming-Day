                                         Absolute value: The absolute value of a number is its non-negative value,
                                         regardless of whether itâ€™s positive or negative.
                                         For example, the absolute value of both -5 and 5 is 5.
                                         In C++, abs() is part of the <cmath> library for floating-point numbers
                                         and integers. It ensures that we work with positive differences,
                                         which is useful when calculating how far a value is from some reference.*/

          Using const makes your code more robust and readable by clearly indicating
          that a certain value is not meant to change. This is useful for setting
          constant values like the number of days in a year or a threshold value that
